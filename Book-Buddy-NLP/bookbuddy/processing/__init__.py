# Preproccessing
# Intent Recognition
# NER

# Receive Query: The user inputs a natural language query into the system.
# Preprocess Query: The input text is cleaned and standardized through preprocessing steps to make it more analyzable.
# Intent Recognition: The system analyzes the preprocessed query to understand the user's intent (e.g., seeking a recommendation).
# NER: Alongside or after intent recognition, the system performs NER to extract specific entities related to the intent, such as genres ("science fiction"), themes ("Arab culture"), or other relevant details.
# Process Request: Based on the recognized intent and extracted entities, the system queries book databases or uses recommendation algorithms to find books that match the user's request.
# Provide Recommendations: The system presents the user with a list of book recommendations based on their query.
