# Book-Buddy-NLP

`Book-Buddy-NLP` is a streamlined CLI application created using Python. It interprets natural language queries to provide personalized book suggestions. Leveraging NLP techniques, it parses user input to identify genres, authors, or themes, integrating with various book databases for relevant recommendations.


### Genre Recommendation Requests
- "Suggest some epic fantasy series besides 'The Lord of the Rings'."
- "I'm in the mood for psychological thrillers, any ideas?"
- "What are some good contemporary romance books?"
- "Can you list top-rated science fiction novels of the last decade?"
- "I'd love to dive into some classic American literature. Recommendations?"

### Author Queries
- "Tell me more about books written by Haruki Murakami."
- "Which Margaret Atwood book should I start with?"
- "I'm interested in exploring Raymond Chandler's work. Any suggestions?"

### Mixed Intent Requests (Stretch Goal)

- "After reading 'Dune', I'm craving more epic space operas. Suggestions?"
- "I want a book that mixes mystery with historical fiction, any ideas?"

### General Inquiry and Feedback
